\chapter{Discussion}
\label{ch:Discussion}
% Was war das Ziel? Was wurde (nicht) erreicht?
In this chapter, we will discuss our findings from the experiments in chapter \ref{ch:Evaluation}. Like most chapters in this thesis, we will divide this chapter into two parts, one for continual active learning and one for model stealing. 
The first section will discuss the findings from the first batch of experiments, where we tested Continual Active Learning on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Resnet18. The section on Model Stealing is then used to discuss general findings from
our experiments on Model Stealing as well as findings from applying Continual Active Learning to Model Stealing.
