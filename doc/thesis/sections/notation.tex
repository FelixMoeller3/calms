\chapter*{Notation}
\label{ch:notation}

% Mention b as batch size

This chapter is intended as a quick overview of the mathematical notation used in this work.
The symbols largely follow contemporary works, while simultaneously trying to avoid ambiguity.
Furthermore, the notation refrains from assigning semantics to different font weights, in order to stay consistent across multiple media.

    $y_i$ & The label of the given data point $x_i$, also known as $y(x_i)$. \\ \addlinespace
    $b$ & The number of samples within a batch in Active Learning \\ \addlinespace
