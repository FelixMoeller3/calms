Since our continual learning approach is, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to combine pool-based active learning with continual
learning, we explain our approach in detail in this chapter as well as the motivation for it. We then transfer our approach to the domain of model
stealing. Because we build upon the framework of ActiveThief, we describe how our approach compares to the original approach in detail.
