\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:Conclusion}
% Mention drops in accuracy due to Continual Active Learning. Regarding model stealing
% mention that there are cases where the CAL works a lot better than for normal continual
% active learning. Mention correlation with batch size to support the thesis that CAL fails
% because batch size is not large enough. Mention small difference between different active
% learning approaches for CIFAR-10 at least, which are inline with the findings from Yilins
% paper.
This is the conclusion of the thesis.
